title: MCP Server Setup
description: Use ClawCard with Claude and other MCP-compatible AI tools.
---

ClawCard includes a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to manage your virtual cards.

## Setup with Claude Code

Register the MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add clawcard -- npx clawcard-mcp
```

That's it. Claude Code will now have access to all ClawCard tools.

## Setup with Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clawcard": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["clawcard-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `login_status` | Check if you're authenticated with Privacy.com |
| `list_cards` | List all cards (filter by state or creation month) |
| `get_card` | Get full card details including PAN, expiry, and CVC |
| `create_burner` | Create a single-use burner card |
| `create_card` | Create a reusable card with monthly spending limit |
| `update_card` | Update card name, limit, or merchant category |
| `freeze_card` | Pause a card to prevent charges |
| `unfreeze_card` | Resume a paused card |
| `close_card` | Permanently close a card |
| `list_categories` | List available merchant categories |
| `list_transactions` | View transaction history with filters |

## Example usage

Once the MCP server is registered, you can ask Claude:

- "Create a $25 burner card for digitalocean.com"
- "Show me my active cards"
- "Freeze the Netflix card"
- "What did I spend last week?"
- "Close the card ending in 7291"

Claude will use the appropriate MCP tools to carry out your requests.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- You must be logged in (`clawcard login`) before using MCP tools
- The MCP server uses the same credentials stored at `~/.clawcard/config.json`

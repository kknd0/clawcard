## Install

Run ClawCard directly with npx — no global install needed:

```bash
npx clawcard
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g clawcard
```

## Login

Authenticate with your Privacy.com account:

```bash
clawcard login -e you@email.com
```

You'll receive a one-time code via email. Enter it to complete authentication.

Your credentials are stored securely at `~/.clawcard/config.json` with `0600` permissions.

## Create your first card

### Burner card (single-use)

Perfect for one-time purchases. The amount rounds up to the next whole dollar:

```bash
clawcard burner 25.50 -m "amazon.com"
```

```
Burner Card Created
  Number:   4242 8310 •••• 7291
  CVC:      •••
  Merchant: amazon.com
  Limit:    $26.00
  Type:     single use
  Status:   active
```

### Reusable card (subscriptions)

For recurring payments with a monthly spending limit:

```bash
clawcard create -n "Netflix" -l 23 -c entertainment
```

```
Reusable Card Created
  Name:     Netflix
  Category: entertainment
  Limit:    $23.00/monthly
  Status:   active
```

## Card lifecycle

```
ONE-TIME PURCHASE
  burner 25.50 -m "amazon.com"  →  active  →  payment  →  exhausted

RECURRING PAYMENT
  create -n "Spotify" -l 16     →  active  →  payment
                                    done <id>  →  frozen
                                    use <id>   →  active  →  ...
```

Use `clawcard done <id>` to freeze a card after payment, and `clawcard use <id>` to unfreeze it when you need it again.

description: Install the ClawCard skill for guided card management in Claude Code.
---

The ClawCard skill gives Claude Code guided knowledge about card management workflows and best practices.

## Installation

Install via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh):

```bash
npx skills add kknd0/clawcard
```

## What the skill provides

The skill teaches Claude Code how to:

- Check login status before running commands
- Create burner and reusable cards with proper parameters
- Use the freeze/unfreeze workflow for recurring payments
- Handle merchant categories with prefix matching
- View and filter transaction history
- Confirm before permanently closing cards

## Skill vs MCP server

| | Skill | MCP Server |
|---|---|---|
| **How it works** | Adds context to Claude's prompt | Gives Claude callable tools |
| **Install** | `npx skills add kknd0/clawcard` | `claude mcp add clawcard -- npx clawcard-mcp` |
| **Execution** | Claude runs CLI via Bash | Claude calls MCP tools directly |
| **Best for** | Guided workflows with explanations | Direct programmatic access |

You can use both together — the skill provides workflow guidance while the MCP server provides direct tool access.

## Example interactions

After installing the skill, try:

- "Create a card for my Spotify subscription at $16/month"
- "I need a one-time card for a $50 purchase on newegg.com"
- "Show me all my frozen cards"
- "What transactions happened this week?"

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js 18+
2. ClawCard installed: `npm install -g clawcard`
3. Logged in: `clawcard login`
